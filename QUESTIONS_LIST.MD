1. Product Discovery & Sales
These questions test if the bot can actually help you find things and sell them.

Broad Search: "What do you have for men's summer fashion?"

Specific Specs: "Do you have any waterproof boots in size 10?"

Budget Search: "Show me gift ideas under $50."

Stock Check: "Is the [Product Name] available in Blue?"

Bundles: "Do you have any starter kits or bundles?"

Comparison: "What is the difference between [Product A] and [Product B]?"

1. Order Management & Logistics
This is the most critical area for reducing support tickets. You will need a test order number for these.

Tracking: "Where is my order #1234?"

Status Update: "Has my package shipped yet?"

Modification: "Can I change the shipping address for my recent order?"

Cancellation: "I want to cancel my order."

Missing Items: "I received my box but the [Product] was missing."

1. Policies & FAQs
These test the bot's "knowledge base" and its ability to pull info from your Shopify pages.

Returns: "What is your return policy?"

International: "Do you ship to Germany?"

Timeline: "How long does standard shipping take?"

Payments: "Do you accept Apple Pay or installments?"

Sizing: "Where can I find a size chart?"

1. Edge Cases & Stress Tests
Customers don't always type perfectly. Test how "smart" the bot really is.

Typos: "Where is my pakage?" (Testing NLP/Fuzzy matching)

Slang/Natural Language: "I'm lookin for some fresh kicks."

Multi-intent: "I want to track my order and also ask about your return policy."

Out of Context: "What is the weather in London?" (Does it handle "off-topic" gracefully?)

Gibberish: "asdfghjkl" (Does it have a polite fallback?)

1. Escalation & Human Handoff
A bot should know when it’s out of its league.

The "Angry" Customer: "This is the third time I've asked! I want to talk to a person right now."

Complex Issue: "My order arrived damaged, the box was wet, and I need a replacement sent to a different address."

Direct Request: "Agent please." or "I need human help."


TyposNot an issue (pre-set paths).Needs to recognize "tshirt" vs "t-shirt".ContextOften loses context if you restart.Should remember the previous question.SetupEasy but rigid.Harder to train but more human.

Accuracy: Did it give the right answer or the right product link?
Tone: Does it sound like your brand (e.g., "Hey friend!" vs. "Dear Valued Customer")?
